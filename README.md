## The software

This is a university project were we try to get a better understanding of machine learning and neural networks.
We have made a basic pong game in Java. We will try and use a neural network to learn and play the game.

More information in the [wiki](https://github.com/KimMoe/IS-213-Gruppe1/wiki).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to hava ready before using the software, and how to install them.

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development enviroment running

```

1. Download the repository.

2. Download the neuroph 2.94 library from [here](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/download.html).

3. Open the PongNnReborn project in your IDE of choice (we used Netbeans). 

4. Apply the needed libraries from the Neuroph download.

   Neuroph (Needed):

   * Neuroph-adapters
   * Neuroph-contrib
   * Neuroph-core
   * Neuroph-ocr

   Neuroph dependencies (Needed):

   * Ajt
   * Java-ML
   * Logback-core
   * Sfl4-API
   * Sfl4-NOP
   * Weka

   Neuroph (Optional):

   * Neuroph-samples
   * Neuroph-samples-Javadoc
   * Neuroph-adapters-Javadoc
   * Neuroph-contrib-Javadoc
   * Neuroph-core-Javadoc
   * Neuroph-ocr-Javadoc
   

5. Try starting the software by compiling it with the IDE.

6. Use 1-4 and space to change the setting in the pong start menu.

7. Start the game, and enjoy a neural network playing agains a bot, or a human.

8. You can now edit/change the program has much as you would like. You can even fork the project to create your own version.

9. Check out the contribution page for more information on cotribution to the official proram.
