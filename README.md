# Pong with Neural Network

This is a school project were we try to get a better understanding of machine learning and neural networks.
We have made a basic pong game in Java. We will try and use a neural network to learn and play the game.

<br>

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```java
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```java
Give the example
```

And repeat

```java
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

<br>

## Tests

### Running tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```java
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```java
Give an example
```
